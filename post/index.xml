      <description>I have applied for The Data Incubator Fellowship program, a highly competetive fellowship aimed at bringing researchers with exceptional data analysis and statistical talent into industry. During the process I have been asked to update my resume based on some very helpful tips. I wish to share this advice with any fellow researchers interested in applying for industry data science positions. Note that I do NOT own any of the following information and The Data Incubator is completely within its rights to request me to take this post down, should they desire.</description>

      <title>Voting In The Senate</title>

      <description>The changed senate voting system actually makes a big difference to how we should vote this time around. In this blog I describe these changes and what they mean for us.
In the federal election we get to cast two votes, one for the local candidate in the House of Representatives and the other for the Senate Candidate. I am in the electorate of Grayndler which historically has been a very safe Labor seat and even though there is a lot of hype out there about the new Greens candidate Jim Cassey, I still think Albanese is going to safely keep his seat (I would love to be wrong).</description>

      <description>Last Saturday, on 26th March 2016, a friend and fellow climber was injured while attempting a multipitch route near pulpit rock in Blackheath. This is a personal account of the events that unfolded.
The plan was to leave Sydney at 7am, bright and early, and do either some multipitching or canyoning. We could have done one of the Bowens Ck South canyons or Butterbox canyon or either Whymper or Bellbird wall multipitch routes.</description>
