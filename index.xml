      <title>Industry Resume</title>
      <link>https://steefancontractor.github.io/post/industry_cv/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Jul 2018 11:28:31 +1000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://steefancontractor.github.io/post/industry_cv/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have applied for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thedataincubator.com/application_status.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Data Incubator&lt;/a&gt; Fellowship program, a highly competetive fellowship aimed at bringing researchers with exceptional data analysis and statistical talent into industry. During the process I have been asked to update my resume based on some very helpful tips. I wish to share this advice with any fellow researchers interested in applying for industry data science positions. Note that I do NOT own any of the following information and The Data Incubator is completely within its rights to request me to take this post down, should they desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;you will not be judged by the sum total of what you have accomplished, but rather by the average of what you present. So your strategy should only be to present the best things (as judged by your audience) and cut out anything else. The other stuff only detracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resumes should be single-page&lt;/strong&gt;. Two page resumes do not fare nearly as well in front of hiring managers. More often than not, hiring managers will scan for highlights and disregard the second page if you&amp;rsquo;ve included it or throw out all resumes with 2 pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not use less than 11-pt font&lt;/strong&gt;. Do not use a small margin. See above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List at most one to two papers&lt;/strong&gt;. If you have written more, say &amp;ldquo;Wrote 10 published papers, including.&amp;ldquo;Unless your paper was in a top journal in a recognized field (e.g. American Economic Review, Phys. Rev. Lett, Cell, Nature, New England Journal of Medicine, etc.) consider not listing it if you have more valuable information to present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emphasize the computational / data / mathematical / statistical aspects of your work&lt;/strong&gt;. At most 6 lines total spread out across at most 3 projects or jobs. These can be academic, industry, or “for fun” projects. You should approach these with these guidelines in mind:
&lt;ol type=&#34;a&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Emphasize computational / data / mathematical / statistical aspects&lt;/b&gt;. If you spent 24 months collecting data in a lab and 2 weeks analyzing it, talk about those 2 weeks. You are not being hired as a lab rat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Give a specific metric you improved (i.e. give a number)&lt;/b&gt;. People are hiring you to be quantitative, not qualitative, and businesses care about measurable results that you can deliver.&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bad:&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ldquo;Improved model performance&amp;rdquo; (What does &amp;lsquo;improved&amp;rsquo; mean? How much better is the model?) &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Good:&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ldquo;My model lowered RMSE by 20% compared to the state of the art&amp;rdquo; (I know what your metric was and how much better you are according to that metric.)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Good:&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ldquo;My software reduced our codebase size by 30% and ran in half the time&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Short problem domain statements (3-5 words)&lt;/b&gt;. You&amp;rsquo;re not being hired to be a weak analyst.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; E.g. &amp;ldquo;Studied galaxy formation and clustering&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; E.g. &amp;ldquo;Analyzed mice cell division&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emphasize size of data:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;E.g. &amp;ldquo;Analyzed 50GB of sensor data&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;E.g. &amp;ldquo;Analyzed 5 million galaxies&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make it clear what kind of technical problem you&amp;rsquo;re solving&lt;/b&gt;. E.g., ETL, regression, classification, recommender system, unsupervised, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emphasize leadership / group work if possible&lt;/b&gt;. E.g. &amp;ldquo;Led a group,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;organized a colloquia,&amp;rdquo; etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mention a few tools / statistical or mathematical techniques&lt;/b&gt;. E.g. K-Means clustering, logistic regression, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t just say something, show it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bad:&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ldquo;I have great leadership skills&amp;rdquo; (Says who?)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good:&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ldquo;Led a team of 40 researchers to develop a new $30M propulsion system being used in NASA&amp;rsquo;s PlutoX satellite.&amp;rdquo; (Not only did you lead a group, you did so successfully.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stick to objective facts, not subjective descriptors&lt;/b&gt;. Even better, explain why what you did is better:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bad:&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ldquo;I wrote a fast algorithm to analyze a lot of data&amp;rdquo; is subjective (I might think it&amp;rsquo;s a slow algorithm on a small dataset).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Better:&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ldquo;I sped up our analysis algorithm by 20x&amp;rdquo; is objective (there are now no weasel words but I am still skeptical &amp;ndash; how did you do it?).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best:&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ldquo;By caching the most frequently used 1% of the data, I sped up our analysis algorithm by 20x&amp;rdquo; is objective and believable: caching is a common way to make algorithms faster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As an example:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Led group of 4 graduate students to improve energy demand forecasting, analyzed 50GB of data, lowering RMS error by 20% by using a distributed ARIMA model training code (Java).”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fun facts about yourself are great!&lt;/strong&gt; They make a great concluding sentence (&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve traveled to 40 countries,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a martial arts black belt,&amp;rdquo; etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t list GPAs lower than 3.8&lt;/strong&gt;. In general, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to list a GPA at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t list common office software:&lt;/strong&gt; e.g. Microsoft Word, Excel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formatting is important&lt;/strong&gt;. Please find a professional-looking format for your resume by searching for one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the above information I have updated my resume as follows. You can compare this updated resume with my full research CV &lt;a href=&#34;https://steefancontractor.github.io/pdf/SteefanContractor_CV.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ResBaz 2018 - Visualising data on the web with D3</title>

&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://steefancontractor.github.io/ResBazD3&#34; width=&#34;130%&#34; height=&#34;650&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created the above &lt;a href=&#34;https://steefancontractor.github.io/ResBazD3/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;web based visualisation&lt;/a&gt; during a workshop on D3.js at &lt;a href=&#34;https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2018/sydney/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ResBaz 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Here, you can read about my ResBaz experience and learn about how you can create a scatterplot like this too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;resbaz-2018&#34;&gt;ResBaz 2018&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 4th July I participated in ResBaz 2018, an excellent conference for building and sharing research skills as well as networking. It is a fantastic platform for cross-disciplinary information and skill exchange. Plus the food was excellent which was an unexpected bonus (I later found out that they spent 90% of their budget on food!). I highly recommend ResBaz to other early career researchers. This year ResBaz was held in Sydney at the Macquarie University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first two days of the conference attendees participate in various workshops and the third day is focussed on networking. I enrolled into the Advanced Python Workshop, the second day of which had nothing to do with Python, but instead, was focussed on a javascript framework for producing interactive visualisations on the web called D3.js. I have always been interested in picking up D3, since I think it is a great tool for publishing visualisations on the web! The resulting content can be static web pages and do not require servers. However, because of the fine control of every graphic element that D3 offers, it is not useful for creating quick and dirty visualisations. If your aim is to create an interactive plot to explore your data, then I think D3 is not the right tool for it. In such cases you are better off using API services like R Shiny which provide less fine control of the various plot elements but is much quicker to code as a result. Although I had done a brief web course on D3 in the past, I did not feel confident creating various plots in D3 until after this hands-on workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this post is to showcase the web based scatterplot created during this workshop and to give a basic overview of what D3 is and how you can get started with it. If interested, one can go through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mq-software-carpentry.github.io/D3-visualising-data/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Software carpentry D3 course&lt;/a&gt; for step by step instructions on the entire project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-steps-setting-up-the-web-page-with-html-and-css&#34;&gt;First steps - setting up the web page with HTML and CSS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first thing to understand is that D3 is a javascript library for creating web-based visualisations. This means that we need a web page to display the visualisation we create with D3.js. In our case, we created a very simple web page (shown below) using HTML and CSS that we hosted on github pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;!-- link the css stylesheet and load the fonts from google fonts --&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;text/css&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;main.css&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;link href=&amp;quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Pacifico&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;!-- Add a heading --&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;The Wealth and Health of Nations&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt; 
	&amp;lt;!-- Create a div box for the actual chart and give it an id so we can refer to it in the js --&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;chart&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;!-- create a div box for the checkboxes and again give it an id --&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;controls&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

	&amp;lt;!-- We only load the d3.js library and main.js (our code containing the js code) after the  --&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;!-- div boxes with hte appropriate ids are defined in the html to avoid a reference to an   --&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;!-- object --&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;main.js&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-css&#34;&gt;.svg {
	margin-left: 700px;
	width: 50px;
	height: 50px;
}

/*look up chrome.js for colour definitions*/
.circle {
	stroke-width: 3px;
	stroke: black;
	/*fill: #7570b3;*/
}

.label {
	font-size: 16px;
}

.checkbox {
	margin-left: 80px;
}

body {
font-family: &#39;Pacifico&#39;, cursive;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who are not familiar with web development, HTML defines the structure of the web page, so in our case our web page consists of a heading and then a box that will contain the scatterplot and then another box that will contain a bunch of checkboxes to allow us to select/deselect certain regions. However the style of these elements (heading and div boxes) are set by the css. This means that if we would like to, for example, change the position of an element in a web page, or add a border to a div box or change the font of the text in the body, we do this in the css code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now that our web page is set up, we can start writing the actual javascript to create the plot. The final javascript code is shown below. I will not explain every single element, but instead a few key elements that I hope would make the code easier to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;writing-the-js-code-to-create-the-plot&#34;&gt;Writing the JS code to create the plot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34;&gt;// the .then means the function is called only after the json file is downloaded
var dataURL = &#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MQ-software-carpentry/D3-visualising-data/gh-pages/code/nations.json&#39;;
d3.json(dataURL)
	.then( function (nations) {

    	});

    	var filtered_nations = nations.map(function(n) {return n;});

    		} else {

    			})

    		}	
    		update();
    	});


    	var colorScale = d3.scaleOrdinal(d3.schemeCategory10);

		}

	}).catch( function (err) {
		console.error(err)
	});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, the indenting did not preserve after copying the code into the markdown but the basic idea is this - we read the raw data from the url (dataURL). Then we call the d3 library&amp;rsquo;s json function to read this data. We use a &amp;ldquo;.then&amp;rdquo; clause because we do not wish to run the rest of the code unless the data has finished being read in. The output of the json(dataURL) is fed into a function inside the .then clause. We can now assume nations contains all our data and treat it like any other variable. Inside this function (which is inside the .then) we set up all the attributes for our chart, including margin, width, height etc. The basic concept behind how HTML elements can be manipulated using javascript is this, we can select elements using their IDs and then add new tags to them using .append() and add new attributes (such as class, transform etc.), to the tags using .attr().&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things we have done repeatedly in this js code is looping over our data. This is done with the function map. So whenever you encounter &amp;ldquo;nations.map( function (n) )&amp;rdquo;, I am saying &lt;em&gt;loop over the table nations with &amp;ldquo;n&amp;rdquo; representing each row of the table nations&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way we set up the checkboxes in the javascript is also very interesting. We first select the div with ID &amp;ldquo;controls&amp;rdquo;, and create a new div inside this div for each checkbox. Inside each one of these &amp;ldquo;checkbox&amp;rdquo; divs we create another tag &amp;ldquo;input&amp;rdquo; with the attribute &lt;em&gt;type=&amp;ldquo;checkbox&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. To select/deselect data that is fed into our plotting function, we use d3.selectALL() to select all elements of class &amp;ldquo;input&amp;rdquo; and then use the .on() clause on these elements to do &amp;ldquo;something&amp;rdquo; everytime these elements change (i.e. get checked or unchecked).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the checkboxes are created we create the axes for the plot. We create y-axis on a log-scale, and the x-axis on a linear scale and add labels to these axes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we write a function called update(). All the circles are created inside this function. We need to do this inside a function because everytime we check or uncheck a region checkbox, we filter the data accordingly, and then we would like to replot our circles accordingly. So note that back in our code where we select all checkboxes (elements with class &amp;ldquo;input&amp;rdquo;), each time a checkbox is checked or unchecked, we call this update() function to update the plot based on the filtered dataset. I would also like to draw your attention to how we associate each circle with the income, lifeExpectancy, population and region columns of our data inside the update function. To do this we feed the income, lifeExpectancy, population and region data for a particular point to the x position (&amp;ldquo;cx&amp;rdquo;), y position (&amp;ldquo;cy&amp;rdquo;), radius (&amp;ldquo;r&amp;rdquo;) and fill colour (&amp;ldquo;fill&amp;rdquo;) attributes of our circles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not expect most people who have never looked at HTML, CSS or Javascript code to understand what is happening based on just this blogpost. The aim here was to just show you what D3.js is capable of and showcase some interesting and powerful programming concepts that I was not familiar with before trying out D3.js. If you feel inspired please go through the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mq-software-carpentry.github.io/D3-visualising-data/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;step by step instructions&lt;/a&gt; on creating the plot yourself. The best way to progress from their would be to go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://d3js.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;d3js.org&lt;/a&gt; and check out the numerous examples of the various plots you can make with D3. Note also that Chrome and Firefox have amazing developer tools available, which means that while writing the code one can use the &lt;em&gt;Inspect&lt;/em&gt; tool (On mac: Cmd + Shift + C; On windows: Ctrl + Shift + C) in Chrome to see the HTML code related to various plot elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find my github repo &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/steefancontractor/ResBazD3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, the live plot &lt;a href=&#34;https://steefancontractor.github.io/ResBazD3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, the instructor&amp;rsquo;s github &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Spaxe/ResBazD3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the original software-carpentry D3 visualising data repository &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mq-software-carpentry/D3-visualising-data/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Voting In The Senate</title>
      <link>https://steefancontractor.github.io/post/voting-in-the-senate/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://steefancontractor.github.io/post/voting-in-the-senate/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The changed senate voting system actually makes a big difference to how we should vote this time around. In this blog I describe these changes and what they mean for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the federal election we get to cast two votes, one for the local candidate in the House of Representatives and the other for the Senate Candidate. I am in the electorate of Grayndler which historically has been a very safe Labor seat and even though there is a lot of hype out there about the new Greens candidate Jim Cassey, I still think Albanese is going to safely keep his seat (I would love to be wrong). So I think my vote is going be more powerful in the senate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2016/guide/senate/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ABC&amp;rsquo;s 2016 Federal Election Guide&lt;/a&gt; says that among the 12 NSW seats, a possible outcome is, Liberals/National will have 5 safe seats, Labor 4 and Greens 1, with one &amp;ldquo;left&amp;rdquo; seat contested between Labor and Greens and another &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; seat which I couldn&amp;rsquo;t give a damn about. I would like to caste my vote in such a way to make sure the Greens get that &amp;ldquo;left&amp;rdquo; contested seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aec.gov.au/voting/How_to_vote/Voting_Senate.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;new senate voting rules&lt;/a&gt; according to the AEC are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;number at least six boxes above the line for the parties or groups of your choice, or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;number at least 12 boxes below the line for individual candidates of your choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the previous voting system, the new system give one a lot more freedom to make their preferences clear. In the past you either voted a single &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo; above the line and then the AEC would somehow decide your other preferences based on that one &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo;, or you would have had to number all 150 odd candidates below the line to make your preferences clear. For this reason it was more powerful before to vote below the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, however, you only have to number 12 boxes below the line. A probable scenario is that most people will be too lazy to number all 151 candidates this election, so they will likely just number 12 or 20 candidates for example. Let&amp;rsquo;s assume they would like to preference 6 parties of their choice. Since they are only numbering 12 candidates, they might not be able to number all the candidates running for the 6 parties they have narrowed down. Since other voters might not number the exact same candidates, your votes might be distributed among the candidates of a party and your candidates might not get elected. For this reason I think it is more powerful to vote above the line in the Senate ballot paper as you actually get to make your preferences clear this time around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the possible Senate seat outcome predicted by ABC is in the end, just that, a possible outcome, I would recommend tacking on Labor at the end of your preferences so the seat goes to &amp;ldquo;the lesser of two evils&amp;rdquo; in case the seat ends up being contested between Labor and Liberal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarise, if you are voting below the line, number all the candidates, if not, you are probably better off voting above the line which is possibly going to be just as powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I finish I would like to add that even though I am writing this blog from the perspective of a Greens voter, the rules and ideas here apply to a &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; voter as well. After all there is a &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; contested seat in the senate as well. If you do, however, plan on voting &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo;, just remember what John Oliver said in the context of BREXIT; &lt;a href=&#34;http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/27/media/john-oliver-brexit/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;there are no f**king do-overs in an election&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bellbird Wall, Close Call</title>
      <link>https://steefancontractor.github.io/post/bellbird-wall-close-call/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://steefancontractor.github.io/post/bellbird-wall-close-call/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday, on 26th March 2016, a friend and fellow climber was injured while attempting a multipitch route near pulpit rock in Blackheath. This is a personal account of the events that unfolded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan was to leave Sydney at 7am, bright and early, and do either some multipitching or canyoning. We could have done one of the Bowens Ck South canyons or Butterbox canyon or either Whymper or Bellbird wall multipitch routes. We had agreed the night before that we would just decide the next morning on the way to the Blue Mountains. That morning a unanimous decision was made to do some multipitch climbing. None of us had even bothered bringing any canyoning gear. We decided that we would do Bellbird wall since Wen Jun had already done it before and had looked up the track notes on the night before. So we felt confident that we could just do it without having to do much planning ourselves, completely relying on Wen Jun’s memory. Even though half of our party of four had never even done any multipithing, we thought we would be fine since the grades of the pitches were well within our ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up getting picked up at about 8:30am. On the way there Manon and I decided to look up instructions for setting up multipitch anchors on our phones while Bayu drove the car. When Wen Jun realised what we were doing he chuckled - “that’s reassuring!”, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally got to the car park, or at least so we thought, at about 11am. We decided to put all our gear together to see if we had enough. Wen Jun remembered that we needed sixteen quickdraws. Between the four of us we had just enough, or maybe one less, for two sets. We figured it would be okay. Manon needed an extra carabiner and another sling so I gave my spares to her. Wen Jun also gave some of his gear to Bayu and Manon. We decided that Wen Jun and I would climb together and Bayu and Manon would make up the other pair. I decided to leave my bag behind since I didn’t want to climb with a big backpack, especially while leading the slab pitch because Wen Jun “hated” slabs. I gave him my jumper to carry and we decided to share the three litres of water he was carrying. After a quick tutorial from Wen Jun on how to set up an anchor and top belay after leading a pitch, we thought we were all set. We propped our helmets on, pulled up our heavy, gear laden harnesses and started walking down in thongs and climbing shoes, only to realise that we were in the wrong car park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the abseil anchors at midday. Wen Jun remembered the anchors were a short bush-bash to the left of the walking track at the twelve drain mark. We joined the two ropes together with an overhand knot and Wen Jun set the abseil up. He went down first with a prussik backup and fireman belayed Manon and Bayu who followed. I decided to go last. This is when I almost had my fatal accident. I clipped into the safety and shimmied around the corner to the abseil anchor. At this point I was on my tippy-toes and my heels were hanging over the edge with a hundred and fifty metre drop underneath. I pulled up the rope to set up my belay device but the weight of the 100m of rope hanging below made it hard to manage. Normally I would pull up the length I need and step on it to keep it from falling back down and have two hands free to set up my belay device. This time I wasn’t in a comfortable enough situation to do that so I just pulled up the rope, forming a bight, held it in one hand and proceeded to set up my belay device. After checking, I thought that the ropes held my weight and unclipped my safety. Wen Jun replied with “ON BELAY” to my “ABSEILING”. I noticed it when I bent my knees, about to hop off the ledge. I had only fed one of the ropes through my belay device instead of two, and that too the wrong one. If I had put my weight on it, I would have plummeted straight down and no amount of fireman-belaying could have stopped me. With a curse word I straightened myself up and reached around to clip-in my safety. I could feel my heartbeat in my neck. I redid the belay device and started abseiling. I could not stop shaking on the way down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After fifty metres of abseiling, I came off the abseil onto a quadrant shaped ledge. There were loose rocks everywhere on the floor. There were a set of anchor bolts on one end of the ledge facing north, directly at the Grose valley. This was the bottom anchor for the second pitch. There was another set of anchor bolts, just off the ledge on the other end, facing West, along the wall. This was the top anchor for the first pitch which started about 50m West of the ledge. Wen Jun, knowing that pitch one starting ledge was to the West, thought it better to abseil off that end. He also wasn’t sure if there would be a ledge on the other side. Not wanting to be stranded, dangling hundred metres above the valley floor, we all agreed with his decision. He then fed the ropes through an extendable quickdraw on the top pitch-one anchor to keep it from swinging, and abseiled down again with a prussik. At the bottom, about fifty metres below us, he realised that in fact the ledge did go around to the other side making it okay to abseil directly down instead of the West end of the ledge. He screamed trying to relay the information but was incomprehensible to us due to the windy conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I got on the rope second, ready to abseil. I checked my set up multiple times before committing to it. I walked around to the other end and unhooked the ropes from the extendable quickdraw, however, fearing that I might swing without this quickdraw, I could not do it. Manon was much more brave. She convinced me to go ahead in my place claiming that it would be easier for Wen Jun to control her swing due to her being lighter. After setting up her belay device, she walked down to the ledge and just flicked the rope down to the front, reducing the swing. I facepalmed at my inability to do something so simple. On her way down, however, I noticed that the rock the rope was going over on the ledge was loose. It would wobble, threatening to come off every time Manon would lower herself. To keep it from coming off, Bayu and I pushed down on the rope so it was running flat along the ledge. Luckily for us Manon finished abseiling and the rock stayed put. I went next, flicking the rope to the West of the rock so it wasn’t going over it anymore. Bayu followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we reached the bottom it was about 2pm. Wen Jun tried pulling the rope down but it would not budge. Turns out by placing the rope to the West of the rock I had jammed the rope between the rock and the ledge. Of course we did not know this at the time. I made the joke that since I hadn’t had any major incidents in the past on any of my trips, statistically this was bound to happen. I wish I hadn’t made that joke. I knew that if we were unable to free the rope then the rescue party wouldn’t be able to reach us until the day after since I had instructed my girlfriend to call the emergency services if she hadn’t heard from me until the morning after. After much consideration and fruitless attempts to unstuck the rope, Wen Jun decided to prussik up the rope. Him and I were the only ones with prussiks but I did not even offer to go in his stead, justifying in my head that he was more experienced, that he would be quicker. It took him around 45 minutes to prussik fifty metres up to the top and figure out the problem. He placed the rope over a smooth rock and started abseiling down again. On the way down he stepped on a juggy rock and it came loose. Wen Jun screamed “Rock falling”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bayu and I were sitting down with our backs facing the slightly concave wall when we heard the call. Manon was walking towards us from around the corner. We were all wearing helmets. She was about one and half metres from me when it happened. Hearing the call, she leaned into the wall tucking her chin in and the rock, which Wen Jun described later as being the size of his head, fell directly on her back and bounced off the ledge. Upon the impact Manon fell over in our laps and screamed continuously for about a minute. It felt like she could not stop screaming because of the intensity of the pain. Bayu and I held Manon muttering consoling words knowing that none of it helped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she stopped screaming, Manon momentarily closed her eyes, probably in an attempt to calm down. Bayu and I at this point were worried that maybe the rock had hit her head as well, so fearing a concussion we tried to keep her talking and asked her to keep her eyes open. Bayu had attended a first aid training course a couple of weeks earlier. He directed me to fetch his emergency blanket from his bag. I realised at this point that I had left both my emergency blanket and my head torch in the car. I kicked myself for it but carried on with the task at hand. We supported Manon’s head and back and rolled her on her side and slid the emergency blanket under her. We then rolled her over to inspect her injuries. She had a massive bruise just underneath her left shoulder blade with some superficial lacerations. Luckily the rock had missed her spine but at this point we couldn’t be sure of anything. There was also some swelling on the left side of her traps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After another minute or two Manon had regained some movement and decided, despite being strongly discouraged, to sit up. Wen Jun finally came down and let out a sigh of relief when he saw all three of us sitting there. I realised how nerve-wrecking it must have been for him to be up there hearing those screams and not knowing what had happened. We managed to pull the ropes down this time and now had two sets of sixty metre ropes to climb with. Manon at this point was adamant that she was fit enough to climb, but the rest of us knew that it was the adrenaline talking. So we decided that Wen Jun and I would lead the three pitches as fast as we could and call for help when we reach the top, and Bayu would stay and look after Manon. Wen Jun and I gave all our warm gear and food and traversed around to the start of the first pitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was after 4pm when I started leading the first slabby 45m pitch, graded 16. About fifteen metres up, I noticed that my legs were trembling because of recent events. I tried not to think about it and focussed on the climbing. Soon I was so focussed that nothing deterred me, not even the nearly hundred metre exposure. Wen Jun led the second pitch which was also the same length, had an overhangy bit and was graded 17. I marvelled at his ability to lead past the exposed overhang while I seconded up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I emerged at the top of the second pitch, we heard someone call out, “Travellers! Are you okay?”. I replied immediately, “Yes! But we have an injured friend about a hundred metres below us”. Turns out Bayu had a phone on him and although it had no reception, he was able to make an emergency call. Wen Jun, was aware of this but had neglected to mention it to me. I breathed a sigh of relief and continued on with the third pitch. This pitch was only 15m and was graded 15 but was the most interesting of all. It started with an off-width traverse at the end of which you swing around to the jug on the outside of the arete on the end. I could see the whole 100m wall looking down from there. The rest of the route was fairly unimpressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I summitted at the top, there were four emergency workers already there. Soon there was also an ambulance helicopter circling around the valley. I looked to my right and Pulpit rock was packed with tourists more interested in the rescue operation than the majestic Grose valley. Due to the noise of the helicopter, I was unable to communicate with Wen Jun so we were instructed by the rescue party to stay put. Wen Jun seconded up as soon as it was quiet enough. We sat up there, teary eyed, as we witnessed the paramedics abseil down and the helicopter returned to drop a stretcher and more emergency workers. Wen Jun pulled himself together and started documenting the whole operation with photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must have been just after 6pm at this point. We had climbed the three pitches in under two hours, the rescue crew were already here but we still had no idea what was happening down there and if Manon was okay. When asked, the emergency workers replied that they were still in the process of assessing Manon’s injuries and that they did not want to move her until they were absolutely sure it was safe. Manon and Bayu were still on a ledge, fifty metres above the valley floor making it difficult for the helicopter to safely winch her out. Once the rescue workers had finished assessing Manon, she was moved onto the valley floor where there was an opening big enough to carry out the rescue. Unfortunately, however, by the time they had done that, the weather had closed in and the night had fallen. So the paramedics on site were advised by the helicopter crew that Manon would be extracted on first light on the morning after. Manon was given a sleeping bag and Bayu was given a thin blanket, and they spent the night in the Grose valley alongside the rescue crew of four.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all this was being decided by the police rescue inspector and the paramedics inspector, Wen Jun and I had walked back to the car and had dived into the process of informing all our friends and family what had happened. Manon had instructed me to give her dad a call. She had informed me the whereabouts of her phone and the passcode, so I scrolled down her contacts and tapped on “Dad”. To my surprise the phone was answered by her younger sister. After hesitating a little I asked if I could speak to Manon’s dad. Bayu told me later than Manon’s sister had picked up that something was wrong and had started crying immediately. Manon’s dad arrived with her young siblings at around 8pm. He was quite patient while we recounted the day’s events and remained rational. The two inspectors also came and updated all of us on the status of the rescue operation and Manon’s condition. Manon had somehow avoided getting any major injuries, no major fractures, no concussion, nor any back injuries. Her family seemed very content with the news. Knowing there was not much more we could have done, Wen Jun and I decided to head home at around 9pm. We visited Manon in the hospital the next day when she was already making her silly jokes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If asked I would summarize the trip as a disaster with a happy ending. I can’t help but wonder how lucky we were. All of us agreed that this had been a trip of learning. We were a little overconfident and underprepared but at the same time I accept that no amount of preparedness could have saved the accident from happening. That is not to say that there is not much point being prepared. On the contrary, I think one should be as prepared as they can be, because when the inevitable happens, you don’t wanna have any regrets about things you could have changed by being prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the rescue workers who saved the day. I would also like to extend all my love, appreciation and thanks to Wen Jun, Bayu and Manon who were all skillful, brave, rational and selfless in the face of adversity. You guys are the best! 😄&lt;/p&gt;
